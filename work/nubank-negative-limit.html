            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">One of the roles of a product designer is to identify possible problems in an experience. And one way that I had to observe the clients’ feedback was to look at user comments on social media, customer service chat, or on the company&#x27;s public forum. In one of these searches, I was able to observe a pattern of questions about the credit card limit – which was the squad I worked for.</div>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">Credit cards can be a useful tool for building credit and making larger purchases. However, it is common for customers to not fully understand how credit cards work (or, in this case, how the company explained how credit card limits work), which can lead them to spend more than they can afford. My team and I were looking for small improvement projects that could have a positive impact, and we understood that this initiative could meet what we were looking for.<br></div>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">In this case, I explain a little bit about a quick win experience that could completely solve the doubts that our users had.</div>

              <li class="list-item">If it’s negative, why this information shows in green color?</li>

            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">But after all, what is the negative limit? I didn&#x27;t understand it, and I didn&#x27;t even know when it was in this status. <br>From that point, I asked about this issue some stakeholders on this topic, and I discovered the following information below:</div>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for Overlimit</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">These are cases where the customer had a low limit and made a purchase. The system identifies the need, and in exception, it ends up approving the transaction.</div>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for adjustment in the app</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">Those are simpler. As the customer can adjust the limit bar in the app, if they spent more than what is adjusted, the limit may appear as negative.</div>
            <ul id="w-node-_43a86828-1400-66d4-1024-65a766ab10f5-9bbaa869" role="list" class="paragraph-light">
              <li class="list-item2">Example: The customer has a pre-approved limit of 1000 BRL. They have already spent 500 BRL, but they accessed the app and left it set at 300 BRL. This will make the limit negative at 200 BRL.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for installments payments</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">If the customer has his bill in installments, whether manual or mandatory, the interest will compromise the limit.</div>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for interest, fine, or FTT</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">This is very similar to the previous case. If the customer is late on a previous bill, paid late, or made international purchases, the interest, fine, or FTT compromise the limit, which may leave it negative.</div>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for temp limits</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">When a customer receives a limit temporary increase reactive, they have a limit above their definitive limit for a period. Thus, when this period ends, the limit is again lower than the temporary limit, and the limit will become negative.</div>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for emergencial limit</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">Similar to temp limit, the limit stays above the permanent for a set amount of time. And so when it goes back to its perm, it goes negative.</div>
            <h3 class="heading section-subheading">Negative limit for Rewards program</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">When the customer limit is below normal, and there is a charge for the Rewards program subscription, the limit becomes negative.</div>

          <div class="subsection-wrap">
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">The routine of a digital product that is already in progress is quite different than a new product that has not yet gone live. Some professionals have already worked on the team you are working and they didn’t always predict (because we can&#x27;t predict everything!) all the possible problems.<br></div>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">Often being in an intense routine of a product, the designer does what gives a faster return and becomes a process of continuous improvement - as was my case with this project.<br></div>
            <div class="paragraph-light space-below">As learnings, I believe that secondary research can greatly help to understand the voice of the client for timely improvements or before having a more in-depth research on the subject. Often we have the answers &quot;in-house&quot; and normally, we don&#x27;t use the tools we have in our favor and it was fundamental to the success of this project.<br></div>
